Safety DSL is built by leveraging [Xtext](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/), a language development framework provided as an Eclipse plug-in. The DSL is defined Xtext, we wrote our code generator using Xtend provided in Xtext framework for the safety DSL. Xtext and the corresponding code generator creates the parser and runnable language artifacts. From these artifacts, Xtext generates a full-featured Eclipse text editor. 

Here is a screenshot from the text editor:
